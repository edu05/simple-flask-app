      <h1> Welcome to our site! </h1>
      <p> We all stared excitedly at our CodeFirst: Girls tutors, keen to absorb everything they had to teach us since this was the first time we'd ever coded Python and thought we would master it since we did oh-so-well at our previous HTML, CSS and JavaScript course. Turns out it wasn't so easy. But we powered through with our confused spirits. The minute they mentioned the competition, we knew this was our moment. To showcase everything we had learnt from the past 7 weeks. It all boiled down to this. Our skill sets, sense of humour, keen-ness brought us together. So here we are....presenting you with Creative Aspirations! </p>
      <p> The title says it all - with the added bit of being interested in Tech, of course. We created this to provide people within the Tech industry, or even looking to move into the Tech field, a sense of creativity. A sense of not being tied to your code, but exploring the freedom that may come from your ability to understand and write code. Insert more here...</p>
