      <h1> Welcome to our site! </h1>
      <h2> We all stared excitedly at our CodeFirst: Girls tutors, keen to absorb everything they had to teach us since this was the first time we'd ever coded Python and thought we would master it since we did oh-so-well at our previous HTML, CSS and JavaScript course. Turns out it wasn't so easy. But we powered through with our confused spirits. The minute they mentioned the competition, we knew this was our moment. To showcase everything we had learnt from the past 7 weeks. It all boiled down to this. Our skill sets, sense of humour, keen-ness brought us together. So here we are....presenting you with Creative Finder! </h2>

      <h2> The title says it all - Creativity finder is a collaborative project supporting young Londoners to follow their creative dreams. It takes the concept of a work life balance and encourages aspiring creatives to fuel their passions by attending inspirational events, socialising with like minded people and hearing from positive role models. Itâ€™s also a place to seek advice, network with industry professionals, find work experience and search for jobs.</h2>

      "I consider myself to be a Python disruptionist, who is seeking technological nirvana. I split my time between living in my yurt and selling my organic yak yoghurts at farmer's markets and ensuring my chakras are balanced, and furiously troubleshooting html and writing bad code with hopes to use my coding skills for good. I would describe myself as: determined, eager, clueless."</p>
